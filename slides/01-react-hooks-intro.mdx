Great, more/less than I expected.

## What are React Hooks?

<ul>

    <li>functions</li>
    <li> >= v16.8.0</li>
    <li>Hooks don’t work inside classes</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
React Hooks are nothing more but javascript functions.
[CLICK]
They let you "hook" into React state and other React Lifecycle features from function components.
[CLICK]
React Hooks are available with the release of version 16.8.0 and are 100% backwards-compatible.
Hooks don’t contain any breaking changes.

Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.
They work only inside function components.

## React Class vs. useState Hook

<Notes>
Here we can see on left side the React class usind state and
od right side useState Hook.
Perhaps you’re wondering where React keeps the state for Hooks. The answer is it’s kept in the exact same place where 
React keeps state for classes. React has an internal update queue which is the source of truth for any state, 
no matter how you define your components.

There are a lot of debates regarding hooks vs classes, what is better, if I should rewrite my whole app to hooks etc. 
There are no plans to remove classes from React.
As written in the React docs, at Facebook, they have tens of thousands of components written as classes, and they have 
absolutely no plans to rewrite them. Instead, they are starting to use Hooks in the new code side by side with classes.
